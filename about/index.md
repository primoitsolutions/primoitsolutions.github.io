###About Me
Hi There, I'm Mohan in my mid 30's residing in London. I'm a person who lives and breathes computers. My craze for them made me fly from India to London to do my Masters in Information Security and Computer Forensics. I have 10+ years of experience in Linux/System Administration. I'm passionate about working with open source technologies and enjoy troubleshooting complex Issues. More details about me can be found on <a href="http://uk.linkedin.com/in/mohanb"> <img src="https://static.licdn.com/scds/common/u/img/webpromo/btn_myprofile_160x33.png" width="160" height="33" border="0" alt="View Mohan Balasundaram's profile on LinkedIn"></a>. <br />
