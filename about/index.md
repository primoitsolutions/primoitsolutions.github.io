Hi There, I'm Mohan in my mid 30's residing in London. I'm a person who lives and breaths computers. My craze for them made me fly from India to London to do my Masters in Information Security and Computer Forensics. I have 8+ years of experience in Linux/System Administration. I'm passionate about working with open source technologies and enjoy troubleshooting complex Issues. More details about me can be found on my linkedin.<br />

Thanks for stopping by!
